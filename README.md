# SmashTV
This is a repo for the SmahTV-esque prototype I am working on in Unity.

## How To Play
- Run scene "SampleScene" to begin playing

### Controls
- WASD to move
- Click to shoot
- Aim mouse where you want to shoot

### Enemy Logic (WIP)
- Do damage to the player when they contact the player
- LookAt and MoveTowards the player now
- Shoot at the player (2 second intervals)
- Enemies respawn (to a max of 3)
- 4 hits to an enemy kills them
